# Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me:

Hi! I'm @rafaeldrc, an Economics student at the University of São Paulo (USP). My fields of interest are **econometrics**, **macroeconomics**, but **data analysis** as a whole is very exciting for me. Especially for applications in **finance and business**! 📊

Right now I'm working on learning **Python** and **R** languages. You can check some of the projects I have taken part in each one of them under [my repositories](https://github.com/rafaeldrc?tab=repositories). 📝

Well that's why I joined **[FEA.dev](https://github.com/fea-dev-usp)**, a study group focused on developing **programming skills for business**! There I had a great collaborative environment for USP students looking to enhance their skills by *both* teaching and learning from each other. 📚
